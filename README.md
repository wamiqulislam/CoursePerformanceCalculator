A calculator that shows how well you're doing compared to average in your Course. You input your marks, avg marks, and total marks of each test of an assessment  along with its weightage and you get a report with you're weightage total percentage, weighted avg percentage of the class and the difference btw them.

For reference, you get a B if difference is >0%, B+ if difference is >5%-7%, A if difference is >12%-15% etc. 

(NOTE: These are not definite ranges, just something i got from my experience)
